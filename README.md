# GraphQL Server Using Firebase Functions

### Description
How to setup GraphQL using firebase functions.
This example app demonstrate how to use firebase cloud functions with graphql query using apollo server express.

## What's [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## What's [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) ?

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

## What's [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) ?

Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.

## QuickStart

NOTE: I recommand you to know basics of [firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) and setting up Node projects.
